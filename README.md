# Quantum Run
## Van Dyke Group Games Project

### Description

** A Concerning Situation **

Back to back co-op game with Kinect body tracking. Each player has complimentary opposite powers that are dependent on each other. The game world is at least partly procedurally generated. Players can switch powers and / or places. 

The setting is CERN, 2009. You are a PHD physicist dealing in antimatter. You are trapped inside the LHC as it spins up for particle acceleration. The LHC, not particularly designed for this, explodes, ripping a black hole in the centre of the earth. 

As a result of the explosion you are split into your matter and antimatter self, bestowing both of you with super physics powers, constructive and destructive respectively. Your goal is to close the portal by joining, annihilating each other, at its centre. However, creatures from another dimension are spilling out of the portal and you must both defend yourself from them, and deal with obstacles with your powers, as you get closer to your destination.
